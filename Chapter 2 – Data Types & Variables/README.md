chapter 2 – Data Types and Variables

In this chapter, I practiced using different types of data in C.

Programs:

 integers_floats.c – Used `int`, `float`, `double`, and `char`
 type_sizes.c – Checked how many bytes each data type uses
 type_modifiers.c – Tried `unsigned`, `short`, and `long`
 constants.c – Used `#define` and `const` to make constants
